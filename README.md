## 1. What are the key security considerations when developing financial applications?

When developing financial applications, security is of utmost importance. Here are some key considerations to ensure data safety:

### i. Authentication & Access Control
- **Strong Authentication**: Enhanced account security ensures that only the correct person can request or view data.
- **Access Control**: Limit users/accounts to only the data necessary for their account to eliminate excessive data exposure.

### ii. Data Protection
- **Encryption**: Encrypt sensitive data both in transit and at rest.
- **Tokenization**: Replace sensitive data (e.g., user ID, card numbers) with tokens to minimize exposure.

### iii. Input Validation
- **Sanitization**: Sanitize all user inputs to prevent SQL injections and Cross-site scripting (XSS).
- **Strict Input Formats**: Define strict input formats for all input fields.
- **Validation**: Validate all inputs on the client-side and server-side before any database transaction.

### iv. Secure Communication
- **Secure Interaction**: Ensure all interactions between client and server are secure.

## 2. Describe the importance of compliance standards such as PCI-DSS and GDPR in financial applications

PCI-DSS & GDPR are important for financial applications due to their role in ensuring security, privacy, and customer trust.

### PCI-DSS (Payment Card Industry Data and Security Standard)
- **Key Importance**:
  - Data Security
  - Fraud Prevention (Reducing card fraud and chargebacks)
  - Trust Building

### GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)
- **Key Importance**:
  - User Privacy
  - Data Breach Accountability
  - Transparency

For financial applications, PCI-DSS and GDPR are not just regulatory but fundamental frameworks that ensure the protection of sensitive data, instill trust with customers, and safeguard against legal and financial consequences.

## 3. Explain the concept of "idempotency" in financial transactions and why it's crucial

When dealing with financial applications, "idempotency" means that if a user or a system sends the same request to initiate a transaction (like transferring money, making a payment, or updating an account), the system should only process that transaction once, regardless of how many times the request is received.

## 1. How would you ensure the UI/UX of a banking web application is both user-friendly and secure?

To ensure the UI/UX of a banking web application is both user-friendly and secure, follow these principles:

### i. Simple and Intuitive Design
- **Clear Navigation**: Make it easy for users to find key functions like checking balances, making transfers, and paying bills. Use familiar icons and labels.
- **Minimalist Approach**: Keep the design clean and simple. Avoid clutter and ensure users can focus on important tasks.
- **Mobile-Friendly**: Ensure the design adapts well to different screen sizes, especially for mobile users.

### ii. Easy Authentication
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Require an additional layer of security, like a code sent to the user's phone, alongside the password.
- **Password Guidelines**: Encourage strong passwords with clear security requirements (e.g., length, special characters).
- **Biometric Authentication**: Allow fingerprint or facial recognition for easier, secure login on supported devices.

### iii. Clear Security Alerts
- **Notifications**: Alert users about suspicious activities, such as logins from new devices or unusual transactions, via email or SMS.
- **Visual Indicators**: Use icons or messages to show secure areas (e.g., a lock icon for payment screens) to reassure users that their data is safe.

## 2. Explain the role of form validation and data masking in financial applications

Form Validation and Data Masking play important roles in keeping financial applications secure and user-friendly:

### Form Validation
- **Prevents Errors**: Ensures users enter the correct information (e.g., valid account numbers, dates) before submission.
- **Enhances Security**: Helps block harmful data like SQL injections or malicious inputs by checking and filtering what users enter.
- **Improves User Experience**: Shows clear error messages so users can correct mistakes easily, reducing frustration.

### Data Masking
- **Protects Sensitive Information**: Hides part of sensitive data (e.g., credit card numbers, bank account details) by replacing it with asterisks or Xs. For example, showing only the last four digits: **** 1234.
- **Reduces Risk**: Even if data is exposed, masked information prevents unauthorized access to full details, keeping user data safe.

## 3. Discuss strategies for handling real-time data updates (e.g., account balance changes) in a React application

Handling real-time data updates in a React application can be achieved through several strategies:

### i. WebSockets
- **WebSockets**: Provide a two-way communication channel between the client and server, enabling real-time updates. Use libraries like `ws` or `socket.io` to establish a WebSocket connection.

### ii. Server-Sent Events (SSE)
- **SSE**: Allows servers to push updates to clients. Use the `EventSource` API to establish an SSE connection.

### iii. React Query
- **React Query**: Provides a simple way to manage data fetching and caching. Use its `useQuery` hook with the `refetchInterval` option to poll for updates.

Other ways to get real-time data include **Polling**, which involves sending periodic requests to the server to fetch updated data.

## 4. What are Progressive Web Apps (PWAs), and how can they benefit a financial institution?

Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) are web applications that use modern web technologies to provide a mobile-app-like experience through a browser. They offer key benefits such as offline capabilities, fast load times, and push notifications, making them highly effective for a variety of use cases, including financial institutions.

### Key Features of PWAs:
- **Offline Functionality**: PWAs can work without an internet connection by caching essential resources, making them ideal for users in areas with unstable connections.
- **App-Like Experience**: They offer a smooth, app-like user interface (UI), with fast load times, responsive design, and a user-friendly experience.
- **Push Notifications**: PWAs can send real-time updates to users, such as account balance changes, transaction alerts, or security notifications.
- **Home Screen Installation**: Users can install a PWA on their deviceâ€™s home screen without needing to visit an app store, making it more accessible.
- **Automatic Updates**: PWAs can automatically update themselves in the background, ensuring users always have the latest version without requiring manual updates.

# Practical Test

## 1. Build a simple React form for online banking login

The app is hosted [HERE](https://bankitfetest.web.app/) to view the login form.

To simulate a successful login, please use:
- **Email**: `test@test.com`
- **Password**: `password`

Any credentials other than the one provided will result in a failed login attempt.

## 2. Create a secure React component that displays a user's transaction history using dummy JSON data, ensuring proper accessibility and formatting.

A successful login will redirect you to the Transactions page, as it is a protected page that requires authentication.
